        CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, 
        including the design, layout and variations in 
        display for different
        devices and screen sizes.

    <pre style="font-family: verdana; font-size: 1em; ">
        HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for 
        formatting a web page!
        
        HTML was created to describe the content of 
        a web page, like:
        
        This is a heading
        
        This is a paragraph.
        
        When tags like "font", and color attributes 
        were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, 
        it started a nightmare for web developers. 

        Development of large websites, where fonts and color 
        information were added to every single page, became
        a long and expensive process.
        
        To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium 
        (W3C) created CSS.
        
        CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

    <p>You can also specify that only specific HTML elements 
        should be affected by a class.</p>
    <pre>In this example only "p" elements with class="center" 
        will be red and center-aligned:
        <h4>p.center{-------}</h4>
    </pre>


    <p>The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements 
        on the page.</p>
