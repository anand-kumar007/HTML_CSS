<body style="border: 10px ridge green; padding: 10px;">

    <p style="font-size: 2em;">Margins are used to create space around elements, 
        outside of any defined borders.</p>
    <pre style="font-size: 1.3em;">
        You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the 
        element within its container.
    
        The element will then take up the specified width, 
        and the remaining space will be split equally between the left and
        right margins.</pre>
        
     

     <div style=" width:300px; margin: auto;border: 1px solid red;">
        This div will be horizontally centered because it has margin: auto;
    </div>
     
     

     <p>
        Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed 
        into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two
        margins. <br>
        
        This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!
     </p>  
    <p>In this example the h1 element has a bottom margin of 50px and the h2 
        element has a top margin of  20px. 
        So, the <br>
        vertical margin between h1 and h2 should have been 70px (50px + 20px). However, due to margin collapse, the actual
        margin ends up being 50px.</p>
    
    <h1 style=" margin: 0 0 50px 0;">Heading 1</h1>
    <h2 style=" margin: 20px 0 0 0;">Heading 2</h2>

        Padding and Element Width
        The CSS width property specifies the width of the element's content area. The content area is the portion inside the
        padding, border, and margin of an element (the box model).
        
        So, if an element has a specified width, the padding added to that element will be added to the total width of the
        element. <strong>This is often an undesirable result.</strong>
    </pre>
    <pre style="font-family: times new roman;">
        To keep the width at 300px, no matter the amount of padding, 
        you can use the box-sizing property.
        
        <em>box-sizing : border-box;</em>

        This causes the element to maintain its width; 
        if you increase the padding, the available content space will decrease.
    </pre>



    <h3>Setting the max-width</h3>
    <pre>
        The problem with the "div" below occurs when the browser window 
        is smaller than the width of the element (500px). 
        
        The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.
    </pre>
    <p>
        Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, 
        to see the difference between the two divs!
    </p>
    <div style="height: 100px; width: 500px; background-color: powderblue;">
        This element has a height of 100 pixels and a width of 500 pixels.
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div style="max-width: 500px; height: 100px; background-color: powderblue;">
        This element has a height of 100 pixels and a max-width of 500 pixels.
    </div>


    <p>
        If you for some reason use both the width property and the max-width 
        property on the same element, and the value of the
        width property is larger than the max-width property; 
        <br> the max-width property will be used (and the width property will
        be ignored
    </p>
