    <h2>Width and height of element</h2>
    <p style="white-space: nowrap;">
       When you set the width and height properties    of an element with CSS,

       you just set the width and height of the content area.

       To calculate the full size of an element, you must also add padding, 
       borders and margins.
    </p>
    <p>
        This "div" element will have a total width of 350px:
        <br>
        <code style="font-weight: bold;" >
            div {
            width: 320px;
            padding: 10px;
            border: 5px solid gray;
            margin: 0;
            }
        </code>
        <p>here is the calculation</p>
        
        <code>
            320px (width)
            + 20px (left + right padding)
            + 10px (left + right border)
            + 0px (left + right margin)
            = 350px
        </code>
    </p>

    <h3>The line-height property is used to specify the space between lines</h3>

    <h2>Fonts</h2>
    <p>
       <strong> On computer screens, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to
         read than serif fonts.</strong>
    </p>
    <pre style="font-size: 1.2em;">
        In CSS there are five generic font families:
        
        Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.

        Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.

        Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look.
        
        Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.

        Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.
    </pre>
    <p>All the different font names belong to one of the generic font families.</p>

        Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size adjustments to make
        paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.
        
        Always use the proper HTML tags, like "h1" - "h6" for headings and "p" for paragraphs.

        The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.
        
        Absolute size:
        
        Sets the text to a specified size
        Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
        Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
        Relative size:
        
        Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
        Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
    </pre>

    <h2>Responsive fonts</h2>
    <p>
        The text size can be set with a vw unit, which means the "viewport width".
        <br>
        That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:
