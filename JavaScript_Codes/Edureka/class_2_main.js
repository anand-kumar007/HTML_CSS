Class Declarations
One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a class, we use the class keyword and follow it with the class' name. Ideally, we always write class names in TitleCase.

An important difference between function declarations and class declarations is that function declarations are hoisted (i.e., can be referenced before they're declared) but class declarations are not. This means we must first declare our class before attempting to access (or reference) it; if we fail to do so, our code throws a ReferenceError.

// 3. constuctor method
/*
The constructor method is a special method we use to create and initialize objects of a class.

A class can only have one special method with the name constructor, and attempting to write a class containing more than one constructor method will throw a SyntaxError.

To implement inheritance, we can use the super keyword in a constructor to call a parent class constructor.

// static methods
/*
Static Methods
Static methods are methods relevant to all instances of a class â€” not just any one instance. These methods receive information from their arguments and not a class instance, which allows us to invoke a class' static methods without creating an instance of the class. In fact, we actually can't call a static method on an instantiated class object (attempting to do so throws a TypeError).

We define a class' static methods using the static keyword. We typically use these methods to create utility functions for applications, as they can't be called on class objects.

// Inheritance 
/*
Inheritance
In essence, this construct allows us to create an object prototype or class that's an extension of another object prototype or class. A class inheriting from some other class (referred to as a superclass or parent class) is called a subclass (or child class). The subclass inherits the superclass' methods and behaviors, but it can also declare new ones or even override existing ones
